This header file contains a (unprofessional) delay function. I coded the function based on the clock speed of 300MHz of TMS570LC43xx.
I calculated a time scale and multiply it by the ammount of milliseconds we require and just call a for loop to count down the 
final time cycle.

Its not exactly accurate but does the job. I tested it for 1 sec delay and the results were acceptable.
The timescale calculated may need to be changed for your system or maybe entirely for different types of delays

Functions:

delay(milliseconds)   -> 1000ms = 1s
