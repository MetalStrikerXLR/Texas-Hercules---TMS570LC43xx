A header file with serial communication functions simmilar to arduino. Just insert the header file in your project, #include it in your code and call the desired functions

Function List:

*Serialbegin(baudrate)
*Serialprint(String) -> double quotations necessary
*Serialprintln(String) -> double quotations necessary
*Serialprint_i(integer value)
*Serialprint_f(float value)

I wanted to overload integer/float/string functions, but couldnt seem to do it. no idea why. If anyone has any idea plz do share.
